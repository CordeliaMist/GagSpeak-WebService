# It goes without saying most of this code is taken directly from mare's webservice

I didn't know how to do any of this, and so I used mare as a massive reference point to help me learn from the way it was structured.

This learning curve involves lots of copying so that I can comment, process the flow of the code, and understand the purpose for its structures.

This is not meant to be seen as stealing, but rather a heavily inspired dive into the networking side of things for me.

An eternal thanks to the mare synchronous dev who struggled through figuring most of this out for making it possible for me to get into this at all.
